# CSC3150-Operating-System

This is another interesting CSC courses I took in CUHK(SZ). (Perhaps all the courses taught by Prof. Chung are intriguingüëç).
<br>
Hope my homework could give you some hints when you are doing your assignments.

<br>
assignments and myy scores:

- simple multi-process program (100/100)
- simple multi-thread program (93/100)
- virtual memory (97/100)
- file system (100/100)
- simple I/O program (100/100)

Good luck!
